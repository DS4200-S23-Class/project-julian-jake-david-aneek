    <h1>Boston Biking Saftey Risk</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
        &emsp;Boston, the oldest city of the United States, is constantly evolving; urban planners are actively working alongside policymakers to promote an ergonomic and modernized city. Among these positive macrotrends within the city, is the increase in number of Bostonians using bicycles as their main form of transportation. With this increase, it has slowly been revealed over time that Boston boasts the highest rate of bicycle related fatalities and injuries. Experts have blamed this disappointing statistic on the city’s outdated infrastructure and the high population of bicyclists within city lines. It is clear that biker safety has become a pressing issue and one that needs to be addressed imminently.

        &emsp;The goal of this visualization tool is to provide meaningful insights, in an easily digestible manner, that highlight high-risk areas, dangerous Blue-bike stations, and the factors that contribute and drive the associated risks. It is pertinent to identify these areas as then a downward pressure will be placed on urban planners and government officials to address this issue. This tool can directly contribute to invoke change in city planning. The ideal use case of this visualization is for those looking to identify, understand, and locate the risks of biking across Boston. Potential end users include government engineers looking to rectify problem spots, BlueBike employees selecting a location for a new station, and the general public to pinpoint the safest travel route.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Data</h3>

        <p>The project utilizes two datasets. The first dataset is from a website called Analyze Boston[3]. This data was collected by the Vision Zero Boston program. This dataset contains records of the date, time, location, and what type of vehicle was involved in the crash. There are some important details in the description of the dataset, which eliminate bias. For one, the accidents in the dataset are those which demanded public safety agency, which improves the accuracy of our dataset because all serious crashes are noted. Additionally, there are no duplicate recordings in our dataset. One incident is marked by one row in the data. However, there could be an accident that primarily involves cars and a bike, and perhaps ‘bike’ was not listed in the vehicle column. The last bias that needs to be noted is recency bias. New data is appended monthly on Analyze Boston, so we may not have accidents that occurred in March. Our data cleaning process is as follows. We first filtered the “mode_type” column to only contain rows with the value “bike”. This means only bike-related incidents are in the dataset. Furthermore, we eliminated any data before 2020, because the landscape of Boston has been changing due to improvements by city designers.

        The second dataset is from Bluebikes [4]. This data is part of the Bluebikes system data, and it is collected from the bikes that customers ride. There is a lot of data collected from a singular ride. This includes trip duration (in seconds), start time, end time, the locations of the stations where the bike was picked up and dropped off, the station id and town locations, and the user type and postal code. The dataset contains bike rides from January 2023. The only concern with the dataset is if every bike checked out in January is included in the dataset. If an individual rents a bike and fails to return it to a station, the data is perhaps not recorded. We can assume this rarely happens, and this will not significantly impact our visualization tool. Our data cleaning process is as follows. First, we filtered the data to only contain the columns of interest: Trip duration, start station latitude, end station latitude, start location longitude, end station longitude, and the names of the start station and end station. Then, we created an aggregated dataset from the dataset, which contains the average ride time per each start station.
