    <h1>Boston Biking Saftey Risk</h1>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
        &emsp;Boston, the oldest city of the United States, is constantly evolving; urban planners are actively working alongside policymakers to promote an ergonomic and modernized city. Among these positive macrotrends within the city, is the increase in number of Bostonians using bicycles as their main form of transportation. With this increase, it has slowly been revealed over time that Boston boasts the highest rate of bicycle related fatalities and injuries. Experts have blamed this disappointing statistic on the cityâ€™s outdated infrastructure and the high population of bicyclists within city lines. It is clear that biker safety has become a pressing issue and one that needs to be addressed imminently.

        &emsp;The goal of this visualization tool is to provide meaningful insights, in an easily digestible manner, that highlight high-risk areas, dangerous Blue-bike stations, and the factors that contribute and drive the associated risks. It is pertinent to identify these areas as then a downward pressure will be placed on urban planners and government officials to address this issue. This tool can directly contribute to invoke change in city planning. The ideal use case of this visualization is for those looking to identify, understand, and locate the risks of biking across Boston. Potential end users include government engineers looking to rectify problem spots, BlueBike employees selecting a location for a new station, and the general public to pinpoint the safest travel route.
