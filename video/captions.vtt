Alright, hello everyone  

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.033
    Thank you for watching. This is our group 

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.055
 Project, and we are here to showcase 

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:09.055
 our Boston Biking 

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.055
Visualization tool. So

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.055
we'll just jump right into it and showcase

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:14.531
how we are 

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:16.031
how you can use this tool 

00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:18.031
 So once you scroll down from our abstract

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.031
and data overview section, you can see our Boston map 

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.031
on the left, which highlights

00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:24.031
 accidents which have occurred 

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.031
in Boston, and also the BlueBike stations

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:28.031
which are located in Boston, and 

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:30.031
there are two modes which you can toggle between

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.031
one is a zoom functionality where you can

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.031
zoom in and out 

00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:36.031
of the map and you can also 

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.031
drag as well to

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:40.031
just kind of explore what's happening 

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:42.031
you can also hover over 

00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:44.031
the blue 

00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.031
marks which indicate the stations

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.031
and you can see the in and out flow of each station 

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.031
and then the

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.031
other 

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.031
aspect of the toggle button is brushing and linking

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.031
so you can see the different cursor we have here

00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.031
and 

00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.031
you can just highlight over

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:02.031
various stations 

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:04.031
and it will show you 

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.031
the proportion of 

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.031
 

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.031
accidents which have occurred on the 

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.031
street, and then the portion of accidents 

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:14.031
that have occurred on an intersection 

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.031
and then it also shows the frequency count as well

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:18.031
as you can see if more areas

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.031
of Boston have more

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.031
accidents then others 

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.031
and yea that's our tool in full

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.031
so thank you for watching

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.031
